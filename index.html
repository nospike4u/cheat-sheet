                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Prioritize Features: </strong>Set a priority for the features (Major, minor and nice to have)

                        <li><strong>Build Prototypes: </strong>Use tools like Figma or Excalidraw to create prototypes.
                            Plan the technologies that you will use:</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose Tech Stack:</strong> Decide on the technologies to be used, such as React, Vite, and any necessary libraries or frameworks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Define Architecture:</strong> Outline the app’s architecture, including component structure, state management, and backend integration (if needed).
                            Develop Project Plan and Timeline:</li>
                        <li><strong>Assign Tasks:</strong> Distribute tasks among team members based on their skills and expertise. (Remember to always get out of your comfort zone and try new things. You are here to learn)</li>

                        What is a frontend? The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly. It includes everything users experience visually in their browser or application screen.
                        
                        Common terminologies in React:
                        
                        Components: Reusable building blocks for UI, written in JSX.
                        State: Manages dynamic data within components.
                        Props: Pass data between components.
                        Hooks: Functions like useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects.
                        
                        Key Tasks in React:
                        
                        Rendering UI: Displaying content and structure.
                        Handling User Input: Responding to clicks, typing, etc.
                        Communicating with Backend: Fetching and sending data via APIs.
                        
                        
                        </li>
                    <li>Setting up your Frontend
                        Creating a React Vite app repository when there is no repository yet
                        - Open the terminal in vs code and navigate to the project folder.
                        - Run the code "<code>npm create vite@latest</code>" to kickstart your application.
                        - Give the name of your repository. Do so an press enter.
                        - Give the name of your project. Just press enter so it uses the same name as in the repository.
                        - Give the framework of your application. With the arrows up and down move to "React" and press enter.
                        - Give the language you will use in the app. With the arrows up and down move to "javascript" and press enter.
                        - Wait until your app finish the creation process. Once it is done, the terminal will give you the instructions on the code you need to run to start your app.
                        - cd name-of-reacr-app-folder 
                        - <code>npm install</code>-> this will take a few seconds, as is installing all the dependencies and the node modules necesary for your react app to work.
                        - <code>npm run dev</code> -> do this once the <code>npm install</code> finishes to create a live server for your react app. The link to the live server will appear in the terminal, so to open it you can copy paste it into the browser, or clicking on the address while pressing ctrl.
                        2.2 Creating a React Vite App inside the repository you are currently located at in the terminal
                        - Open the terminal in vs code and navigate to the project folder.
                        Create a directory with the mkdir command and name it as needed
                        - cd in that directory.
                        - Run the command "<code>npm create vite@latest</code>."
                        - Give the name of your project. Just press enter so it uses the same name as in the repository.
                        - Give the framework of your application. With the arrows up and down move to "React" and press enter.
                        - Give the language you will use in the app. With the arrows up and down move to "javascript" and press enter.
                        - Wait until your app finish the creation process. Once it is done, the terminal will give you the instructions on the code you need to run to start your app.
                        - <code>npm install</code> -> this will take a few seconds, as is installing all the dependencies and the node modules necesary for your react app to work.
                        - <code>npm run dev</code> -> do this once the <code>npm install</code> finishes to create a live server for your react app. The link to the live server will appear in the terminal, so to open it you can copy paste it into the browser, or clicking on the address while pressing ctrl.</li>
                    <li>Install necessary packages
                        This will be dependent on the necessity of the project, but remember to install the most common packages like React-Dom using the NPM commands.
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>Test your project
                            Test if everything was set up correctly using the NPM RUN DEV command.</li>

                                    <li>What is Backend?
                                        Backend refers to the server-side portion of a web application.
                                        It processes requests received from the client-side (frontend) and interacts with databases to generate results.

                                    <li>Key Components of Backend
                                        .Web Server: Handles HTTP requests and serves static files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).
                                        .Application Server: Generates dynamic content and executes business logic. Examples: Flask, Django (Python), Express (Node.js).
                                        .Database: Stores and manages data. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (NoSQL).</li>
